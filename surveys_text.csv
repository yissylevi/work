QuestionI live one day at a time and don't really think about the future."I tend to focus on the present, because the future always brings me problems. "My daily activities often seem trivial and unimportant to me.I don't have a good sense of what it is that I am trying to accomplish in my life."I used to set goals for myself, but that now seems a waste of time."I enjoy making plans for the future and working to make them a reality. I am an active person in carrying out the plans I set for myself."Some people wander aimlessly through life, but I am not one of them. "I sometimes feel as if I’ve done all there is to do in life.I have a definite sense of purpose in life.I have a firm sense of who I am. I have a set of basic beliefs and values that guide my actions and decisions.I know what I want out of life.I have a clear set of personal values or moral standards.I don’t know where I fit in the world.I have specific personal goals for the future.I have a clear sense of who I want to be when I am an adult.There is not enough purpose in my life. "To me, the things I do are all worthwhile. "Most of what I do seems trivial and unimportant to me. I value my activities a lot. I don’t care very much about the things I do. I have lots of reasons for living.
