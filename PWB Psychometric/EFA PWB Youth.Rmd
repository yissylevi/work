1.	I live one day at a time and don't really think about the future. (rs)
2.	I tend to focus on the present, because the future always brings me problems. (rs)
3.	My daily activities often seem trivial and unimportant to me. (rs)
4.	I don't have a good sense of what it is that I am trying to accomplish in my life. (rs)
5.	I used to set goals for myself, but that now seems a waste of time. (rs)
6.	I enjoy making plans for the future and working to make them a reality. 
7.	I am an active person in carrying out the plans I set for myself. 
8.	Some people wander aimlessly through life, but I am not one of them. 
9.	I sometimes feel as if Iâ€™ve done all there is to do in life. (rs)
